Reviewing Revature code so I have easier things to make to get my brain juices full of Java than with Leetcode

* Most common character
* nth number of fibonacci
* largest sum can be obtained from a pair of numbers (not both the same unless dupes)
* Reverse a string
* isogram check (no letter repeated)
  * just check if hash set size is string length
* find where number should be inserted in sorted list
* take in one word make pig latin 
  * bonus make sentance pig latin
* check if string is palindrome
* return part of array given by start and end (not array list)
* return a map with word count per word
* return how many words in sentence total
* check if two seperate values sum to specific sum
* return if array contains dupe values
* string that has all characters of another string removed
  * use indexOf
* return longest string of array
* combine two arrays into single array and return it
* return true if array sorted
* does not contain
* max minus min
* arrays are equal
* contains
